"""Lazily-constructed external clients (Mongo, Voyage, S3).

Clients are built on first use and cached per-process, so importing an activity
module never opens a socket. Activities run in the worker process (outside the
Temporal workflow sandbox), so real I/O clients are safe here.

Credentials are resolved on every call rather than once at import. Under Temporal
that changes nothing: the worker's environment is fixed before the process
starts. It matters in the Agent Engine Tool Pod, where ``pipeline.config``'s
``settings`` singleton is built when the tool module is imported, which can be
before the sandbox's secrets are in the environment. Resolving late, and keying
each cache on the resolved value, means a client built from a blank credential is
never the one handed to a later caller.
